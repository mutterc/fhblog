Title: About Me

Slug: about-me

I'm Corey Mutter, a middle-aged programmer living in Raleigh.

Info here may help you, the reader, understand my perspective on
some of the issues discussed on the blog.

## Basics

Married with two kids, one of whom is the disabled kind of autistic.

Been poor as a kid, well-off-ish as an adult.

Worked elections for a long time, running my polling place since 2005.

I've been fat but am at a reasonable weight after bariatric surgery, so I know
plenty about nutrition and dieting.

## Political Leanings
Unapologetically liberal, though I try to keep an open mind (there are no
evil mutants, after all).
