What's the deal with this blog?

Mostly I just want to collect and develop my thoughts on policy, by getting
them out there. I also like explaining stuff so there will be some of that.

I don't expect much if any readership, but I use 100% recycled electrons so
that's OK.

Nonetheless, I'll strive to be as intellectually honest as possible. The
source of this blog is in [a public Github repo](https://github.com/mutterc/fhblog),
so any changes are publicly visible.

I expect to change my mind every now and again while researching an article,
and will write about that as well.

The very-generic look is just to keep design considerations from slowing this
endeavor down - eventually in my Copious Free Time there will be a better
design. It should at least be fast-loading and easily-readable.
