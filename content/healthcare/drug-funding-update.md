# Dean Baker of CEPR

After finally following @jdcmedlock on Twitter, I saw him mention a proposal
for publicly funding drug development by Dean Baker.

It's always nice to find one's pet theories out there; having not seen it
before, people might not be talking about it because it's original, or
people might not be talking about it because it's obviously stupid. At least
now I have some evidence against the latter.

Medlock quotes a plan from chapter 5 of Baker's book [Rigged](https://deanbaker.net/books/rigged.htm).
It's well thought out, including ways to help keep from falling into
public-choice traps (e.g. contracting the research in a way similar to
defense contracting). He calculates *much* more savings: $300 billion a year
as a conservative estimate.

So go check it out.

# Proposal from 2004

Baker's references pointed me to [a proposal along these lines from 2004](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/5155?r=31&s=1),
from some dude named Dennis Kucinich.
