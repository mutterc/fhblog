Summary: "Job" in The Discourse means 2 very different things.
estat: anodyne

Currently when people talk about "a job", they might mean one or the other
of these:

1. A simple transaction, exchanging labor for cash.
2. A source of identity and purpose (what do you want to "be" when
you grow up), the only thing between your family and homelessness / starvation,
something it's a moral failing not to have.

A lot of confusion and frustration in The Discourse comes from conflating
these two. It's not really a motte and bailey, because they're not really
subsets, and conflating them (or going back and forth) is (unusually for the
Internet) mostly unintentional and/or in good faith.

These create very different policy implications. Job<sub>2</sub>s need
significant protections for employees, some sort of stability, etc.
Job<sub>1</sub>s should be lightly regulated so that people can get on
with making win/win trades.

## Examples

When someone's outraged that an Internet mob has gotten someone fired, they
mean Job<sub>2</sub> - it would not make sense to be very upset about losing
a Job<sub>1</sub>. Likewise, if workers get displaced by an industry leaving
a city / country / planet, whether that's bad depends on whether you're
thinking of Job<sub>1</sub> or Job<sub>2</sub>.

Driving for Uber is (best as I can tell) a great Job<sub>1</sub> and a
lousy Job<sub>2</sub>.

A straw-libertarian view of "employment can never be exploitive without
physical coercion - you must think it's worth the money or you'd do
something else" makes sense, sort of, with Job<sub>1</sub>. A
straw-conservative view of "Job<sub>1</sub> security is the worst thing that 
could happen to an economy" definitely doesn't make sense about Job<sub>2</sub>.

When I was at Big Blue in the late 90s, they were really pushing, from the top
via HR, for us to think of our job as a Job<sub>1</sub>. In the dot-com bubble
lots of folks did, of course. (I used to categorize this as "actively hostile"
but no longer do, thanks to understanding this dichotomy). It did cause
problems, though, when interacting with front-line managers who though of
you as a Job<sub>2</sub> employee.

## Interesting synthesis

I read something insightful in
[this Ask A Manager post](https://www.askamanager.org/2017/04/8-signs-youre-a-bad-boss.html)
(#8) a while back - ideally, your boss is neither your buddy nor your
adversary; you have a _mutually beneficial business relationship_. 
I think this synthesizes the two senses of job well: keep it win/win
(Job<sub>1</sub>) but it's an ongoing relationship (Job<sub>2</sub>).
